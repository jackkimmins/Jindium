# Jindium
“How hard would it be to make my own web platform from scratch?”

This was the question that I set out to answer with this project. Long story short, not that hard, but not worth the effort when there are so many well established and well adopted web systems in place that already achieve the same solution.

Still, I wanted to give it ago regardless and discover this on my own.

Jindium is the result of a couple hours of work that starts from a basic C# .NET Core console application, to a website with sessions, authentication, dynamic content, file compression and exportation and a few other funky features that I added to justify the project’s existence.
